# schematron4word 2025.0

Schematron validation toolkit for word-processing documents.

## Running as a Microsoft Wordâ„¢ Add-in (demo)

1. Open the `demo.docx` document in Microsoft Word
2. "Sideload" the Add-in (see [Instructions Online (e.g. for the web)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing))
3. Open the Schematron 4 Word pane and click the button to show comments
4. Click the button again at any time as issues in the document are addressed to update relevant SVRL comments.

## Running with Ant (Legacy)

This option does not run in the word processing document, but instead processes and retruns an annotated version of the original file.

This option is deprecated in this version of schematron4word, but is available to run from the [Previous Version](../../tree/2016.0).
